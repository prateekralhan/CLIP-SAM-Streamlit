## Installation:
* Simply run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the dependencies.

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository and install the dependencies as mentioned above.
2. Create a ```model``` directory and save the model checkpoints which can be downloaded from [here.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#model-checkpoints)
3. Simply run the command: 
```
streamlit run app.py
```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your web-browser.
5. By default, streamlit allows us to upload files of **max. 200MB**. If you want to have more size for uploading images, execute the command :
```
streamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize=1028
```
